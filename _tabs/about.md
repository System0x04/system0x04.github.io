> Hi there. I'm `System_0x04`, a cybersecurity enthusiast. I'm especially interested in Windows Internals and Maldev. I'm a cheerful and charismatic guy who enjoys making new friends and working as part of a team. I believe in the phrase `"Unity is strength."` It's truly impressive the amazing things that can be achieved as a team.
